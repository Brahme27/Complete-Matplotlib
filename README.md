# Matplotlib Learning Resources ðŸ“Š

This repository compiles my study materials for **Matplotlib**, a core Python library for data visualization.  
The contents are categorized according to the books and courses they were drawn from:

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **Folder 1** â†’ Examples from *Python Data Science Handbook* by Jake VanderPlas  
- **Folder 2** â†’ Exercises from *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron  
- **Folder 3** â†’ Notebooks inspired by *Krish Naikâ€™s Machine Learning Course*  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal here is to provide exposure to a wide set of **Matplotlib functions and plotting techniques**, collected from authoritative sources.  
Please note: some functions showcased may now be **deprecated**, but they remain useful for understanding the evolution of the library.

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Improvement
This is a living repository. I plan to enrich it with additional materials as I encounter stronger or clearer explanations in future resources.  
Currently, it reflects the resources that have contributed most to my learning.
